# odin-landing-page

I am completing various small projects as part of the Odin Project. "Landing Page" is the second project in the Foundations course, which tests basic CSS to create a stylized, responsive landing page. Knowledge tested includes containers, CSS properties and Flexbox CSS.

Note that this site is NOT responsive for mobile devices as this has not been covered yet by the curriculum.
